  Utility functions that maintain the balance properties of the tree.
  All constructors assume that all values in [l] < [k] and all values
  in [r] > [k], and that [l] and [r] are valid trees.
  
  In order of sophistication:
    [Bin sz k x l r]  The type constructor.
    [bin k x l r]     Maintains the correct size, assumes that both [l]
                      and [r] are balanced with respect to each other.
    [balance k x l r] Restores the balance and size.
                      Assumes that the original tree was balanced and
                      that [l] or [r] has changed by at most one element.
    [join k x l r]    Restores balance and size. 

  Furthermore, we can construct a new tree from two trees. Both operations
  assume that all values in [l] < all values in [r] and that [l] and [r]
  are valid:
    [glue l r]        Glues [l] and [r] together. Assumes that [l] and
                      [r] are already balanced with respect to each other.
    [merge l r]       Merges two trees and restores balance.

  Note: in contrast to Adam's paper, we use (<=) comparisons instead
  of (<) comparisons in [join], [merge] and [balance]. 
  Quickcheck (on [difference]) showed that this was necessary in order 
  to maintain the invariants. It is quite unsatisfactory that I haven't 
  been able to find out why this is actually the case! Fortunately, it 
  doesn't hurt to be a bit more conservative.

  [balance l x r] balances two trees with value x.
  The sizes of the trees should balance after decreasing the
  size of one of them. (a rotation).

  [delta] is the maximal relative difference between the sizes of
          two trees, it corresponds with the [w] in Adams' paper.
  [ratio] is the ratio between an outer and inner sibling of the
          heavier subtree in an unbalanced setting. It determines
          whether a double or single rotation should be performed
          to restore balance. It is correspondes with the inverse
          of $\alpha$ in Adam's article.

  Note that:
  - [delta] should be larger than 4.646 with a [ratio] of 2.
  - [delta] should be larger than 3.745 with a [ratio] of 1.534.
  
  - A lower [delta] leads to a more 'perfectly' balanced tree.
  - A higher [delta] performs less rebalancing.

  - Balancing is automatic for random data and a balancing
    scheme is only necessary to avoid pathological worst cases.
    Almost any choice will do, and in practice, a rather large
    [delta] may perform better than smaller one.

  Note: in contrast to Adam's paper, we use a ratio of (at least) [2]
  to decide whether a single or double rotation is needed. Allthough
  he actually proves that this ratio is needed to maintain the
  invariants, his implementation uses an invalid ratio of [1].
